# Audit Contest Findings

Welcome to my repository of valid audit contest findings! This repo documents my submissions to various smart contract auditing contests, primarily through Cyfrin CodeHawks and Sherlock Audit platforms. Below, you'll find tables listing my validated findings for "First Flights" (beginner-friendly audits) and "Audit Contests" (more advanced competitive audits). Each entry links to the specific finding for more details.

## First Flights Findings

These are my validated findings from Cyfrin CodeHawks' First Flights contests, which are designed to help beginners hone their smart contract auditing skills.
